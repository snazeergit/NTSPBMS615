A>To demonstrate CSRF problem comment the below fix in point B and make sure csrf protection is disable by adding 
	http.scrf().disable() in the SecurityConfig class.

	<!-- To fix the CSRF problem -->
	 <input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}"

How to Test CSRF problem:
======================
1. Execute the project "BootSecurityApp06-Form_DBAsAuthProvider-SpringDataJPA-CSRF" as Run on Server 
	but not as Spring Boot application.
2. Now the change the URL on the browser to 
	"http://localhost:2020/BootSecurityApp06-Form_DBAsAuthProvider-SpringDataJPA-CSRF/bank/" 	and select  
	any available operation such as Show Offers.
3. It will redirect you to the login page, so login with snazeer/VMware123! creds and view the offers.
4. Now run the  "BootSecurityApp06-CSRF_Test" application as Run on Server and it will automatically launches index.html
5. Click on the button CLick here to win lottery that will redirect to first application's balance check handler method as 
	we are making the form post request.
	
	
Note: 
=====
Make sure the external Tomcat server is configured to run on 2020 as its been used in the in the index.html page 
<form> tag of  "BootSecurityApp06-CSRF_Test" application. If needed, change the port number in these both places.
Also run the application as Run on Server to run it on External TOmcat Server as the URL formed in "BootSecurityApp06-CSRF_Test"
project is aligned that way.

Embedded Tomcat Server:
======================
	If planning to use embedded Tomcat Server then please make changes on these places.
	1. Tomcat port no in application.properties of first project must be same as the port no specified in the URL present 
		in index.html of second project.
	2. Url specified in index.html must be same as Url for the balance check handler method. i.e click on balance check in 
		first project  and it should match with the url specified in the second project index.html.
